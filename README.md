Data & File Overview
--------------------

### File list:
-- Supplemental_NPP_Code_R_Markdown.rmd - R-markdown file containing reproducible code for constructing general linear models comparing archaeological land use with net primary productivity measruements. The code uses CSV files that compile information derived from satellite datasets from Planet Inc. and NPP data collected by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).

-- NPP_Data.csv - CSV file containing NPP measurements at archaeological sites contained within the study region. Needed to run the Supplemental_NPP_Code_R_Markdown.rmd file.

-- NPP_Data.csv - CSV file containing NPP measurements at archaeological sites contained within the study region. Needed to run the Supplemental_NPP_Code_R_Markdown.rmd file.

-- Sim_Data_v2.csv - CSV file containing NPP measurements at simulated archaeological sites generated from the machine learning analysis. Needed to run the Supplemental_NPP_Code_R_Markdown.rmd file.

-- Combined_Data_V3 - CSV file containing combined NPP measurements at archaeological sites and simulated archaeological sites generated from the machine learning analysis. Needed to run the Supplemental_NPP_Code_R_Markdown.rmd file.

-- Supplemental_Code_ML_R_Markdown.rmd - R-markdown file containing code for replicating the machine learning protocol described in the manuscript. The code uses satellite datasets from Planet Inc. and geographic coordinates of archaeological sites on Madagascar, both of which cannot be publicly shared for legal and/or ethical reasons. These data are available upon request from the authors.
